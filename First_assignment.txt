Hello Students,

This is what you have to do for homework.
Remember the deadline to submit the HW is Wenesday at 8:00:00 am.

I. Read chapter 2 from the book Introduction to Scientific Computing for Biologists Author.   
The book is downloadable here: https://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IntroSciComp2014.pdf

II. Answer the following question. What does this do?   

1. ls [A-Z]*
This command lists all files in your current directory that begin with any capital letter ("[A-Z]"
defines the class as upper-case letters) in alphabetical order. 

2. cp *.sh /tmp
This command copies all files that are ".sh" files to the folder "tmp" (temporary files).

3. man pwd
This command shows the manual for the command "pwd."

4. cd ~
This moves you back to your home directory.

5. mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3 
This makes a creates the directory "test3" nested within directory "test2" nested within directory 
"test1." The "-p" option creates all three of these directories simultaneously. If the "-p" was
not included, "test1" and "test2" would have to already exist for "test3" to be created.

6. cp -r /tmp .
This copies the directory "tmp" (temporary files) recursively, which means including all the 
sub-directories and files.

7. ls | less
This command prints the results of the command "ls," which lists the files in your current 
directory. It does this by using a pipe (the symbol |), which concatenates the two commands "ls" 
and "less" together. 

8. head -n 24 test.txt Â» abc.txt
This appends the first 24 lines of the file "test.txt" to the file "abc.txt".

9. echo "aaa" > aaa.txt
This command makes a text file called "aaa.txt" with the text "aaa".

10. ps -u sallesina
This displays the processes belonging to the user "sallesina".

11. top
This displays a sorted list of system processes.

12. ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp
This takes a list of all files that match the criteria of including the characters ".sh" and 
uses "xargs" to move all of them to the "tmp" (temporary files) folder.

13. du -sk /home/* | sort -r -n | head -10
This sums the files space usage of  all the directories within your "home" directory in kilobytes,
sorts them in reverse numeric order, and then prints the top ten results.

14. sort -r names.txt
This sorts the all lines in "names.txt" in reverse order.
